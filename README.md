# 11 Express.js: Note Taker

## Description of Objective & Purpose
The application, to be named "note taker" as was instructed by starter code, has been assembled for use in order to write and save notes. The contribution to the starter code is the purpose of this particular build; added material will connect the provided frontend with storage and other backend functions which are to be created by the student (it me!).


## Technologies Used

Express.js for the back end, node.js to use node modules. Heroku is used for the deployment.

##
To run this application, clone the repository to local. Within the app directory, use commands "npm init -y" and then "npm install express" and "npm install uuid".
Once the modules are installed, the server can be run locally with the CLI command "node server.js". View the user interface by going to "http://localhost:3000" in your browser.
